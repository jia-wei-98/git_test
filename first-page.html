        <h1>This is my first legit webpage hehh</h1>
        <p>I am trying to add some cool paragraphs here and there</p>
        <p>But honestly it seems like adding paragraphs can be harder than 
            i thought due to the sheer amount of text that I have to type</p>
        <!-- This is just for me to try commenting my code LOL-->
        <h2>This is the second Heading of the webpage</h2>
        <p>This paragraph will have both <strong>bold</strong> and <em>italicised</em> words for styling.</p>
